This repository is a workspace for creating, simulating, and eliciting requirements for a hypothetical system. The system models a real-world scenario to help us learn the fundamentals of software engineering.

Here are the files and their purpose:

- `PRD.md` — The product requirements document for the hypothetical system (Catena). The intent is to make these requirements mirror real-world complexity, including the nuances, edge cases, and operational tradeoffs found in production systems.  
- `learning-goal.md` — The overall learning objective. For the work in this repository we’re focused on step 1 of the Execution Steps, but the full learning goal is included to provide context so simulations better reflect real requirements and constraints.  
- `fundamentals-of-software-architecture.md` and `designing-data-intensive-applications.md` — Core reference materials and learning principles. Read the summaries before simulating requirements so you can apply architectural traits and characteristics when crafting scenarios (Catena in this case).  

**Note:** In real-world projects, architecture and its traits are derived from requirements. For learning purposes, we’ve intentionally inverted that dependency so architectural principles remain explicit while designing realistic problems.
